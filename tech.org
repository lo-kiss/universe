* AR Glasses
Main tech that almost everyone uses these days are the AR glasses.
They are glasses that can diplay virtual interfaces in the real world to better assist you in your activity or show relevant stats.
AR Glasses have extensive support from other manufacturers making them good for jobs, even for a normal day out.

** Out of the box features:
- Display a clock in the corners of your vision (it positioned in such position that you see it only if you look for it);
