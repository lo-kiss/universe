Ships themselves do not have the tech to move between planets.

* Physics
Travel in space differs from travel on ground as in space the gravitational pull is weak. That being said in space a ship can travel at a constant speed with only a push by a force so this can save fuel.

* Ship types
** Commercial
They are big ships for transporting goods and materials.
Independant commercial pilots are the most predominant in this field.

*Fun fact*: the most valuable recource that is traded 24/7 is water.

** Personal
Medium to small, a citizen shoud not have a reason to pilot a big ship. Personal ships can also be used as a mini home as they come equiptted with the day to day utilities;

** Racing
Racing ships are expensive (small for speed and maneuverability) and require an additional license to fly in the few racing tracks that exist. The additional trainning is not intensive, but makes sure pilots know their flying when it comes to racing.

** Touristic
Turisctic companies make big money from this business. Tourists are willing to pay to visit the wonders of the system so the ships used to move those around are luxurious and big. They are often times just like a mini hotel.

** Military
Military ships are not seen flying on citizen ground.

** Police
Police ships are scanning the habitated zones frequently and are highly equipped with powerful gear. There are a few police departments and some of them are weaker due to less money.

* Shape
For ground/ground-space ships I like the way (present) current ships look, but a little more futuristic.
A good reference for what I'm looking is this: [[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ZGm5dx][art_station_link]] or [[~/media/pics/joan_pique_llorens_shuttle_2022-10-19.jpg][local_img_link]]
Space ships could have a bit of a more exotic shape, we're doing sci-fi after all.
In space they don't have to be a specific shape, tho they should make some sense.
If ships will travel both in space and ground then they have to be aerodynamic.

* Manufacturers

* Obtaining a ship
Obtaining a ship license requires intensive training for piloting and possible scenarios in wild space.
The soon-to-be pilots have to pass a theory test and flying test to be able to get a pilot license.
Buying a good lasting ship can hurt the waller a little, but it's managable with a decent job.
