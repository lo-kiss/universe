*Note*: when I say /ground/ I refer to planets or surfaces with high gravitational pull

The ships are realistic.
Ships themselves can not travel between systems, they need to use Laser Gates to travel between systems.
Debating whether there should be alien ships or not (this implies that there are other alien types other than the plant ones).

* Physics
Travel in space differs from travel on ground as in space the gravitational pull is weak. That being said in space a ship can travel at a constant speed with only a push by a force so this can save fuel.

* Ship types
- *Comercial* - they should be big because they transport goods and products;
- *Personal* - medium to small, a citizen shoud not have a reason to pilot a big ship;
- *Racing* - these could also be put into personal, but there are official racing tracks and tournaments happen quite frequiently. They are small for speed and maneuverability;
- *Touristic* - these can be medium to big to transport people across the system. They are often times just like a mini hotel;
- *Military* - These are not flying on citizen areas unless a war is happening. They often sit in garages because not many wars have happened recently (I will change this war thing later);
- *Police* - police ships are scanning the habitated zones frequently and are highly equiptted with powerful gear. There are a few police departments and some of them are weaker due to less money;

** Mini Homes
Like todays cars there are some ships that can be purchased to be used as a home away from home.
These are usually much more expensive and can house at least 3 members.
  
* Shape
For ground/ground-space ships I like the way (present) current ships look, but a little more futuristic.
A good reference for what I'm looking is this: [[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ZGm5dx][art_station_link]] or [[~/media/pics/joan_pique_llorens_shuttle_2022-10-19.jpg][local_img_link]]
Space ships could have a bit of a more exotic shape, we're doing sci-fi after all.
In space they don't have to be a specific shape, tho they should make some sense.
If ships will travel both in space and ground then they have to be aerodynamic.
