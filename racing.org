* Supersonic racing
Supersonic races are done on remote planets and often the races track are as long as circling the planet. These types of races are deadly because if you make a mistake you explode beautifuly.

Ships used in these races are tiny, but rapid and are not found on the white market.

/(requires thinking)/ These types of races are illegal and can range from 20 to 50 years in prison.

* Disk surfing
This is the deadliest race humanity could ever do. So deadly that you need
special racing ships to witstand the force of this race.

There is currently only one place where you can surf and it's on the local black hole in the Gaia BH1 star system. This evetn only happens 4 times a year and it lasts 2 days
